Dear Support Team,

I am writing to report a critical issue with my recent purchase, Order #PROD987. The "Everlasting Widget 2000" I received yesterday is completely non-functional right out of the box. It does not power on at all.

This is utterly unacceptable. I expect a full refund to my original payment method immediately. Please provide instructions for returning this defective product, but my priority is the refund.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent complaint.

Sincerely,
A Disappointed Customer
